## üìå Code Documentation Rules

This project is developed in **Java** and follows industry standards for clean code and documentation.  
We use **Javadoc** for code documentation to ensure clarity and maintainability.

### ‚úÖ **General Guidelines**
- Use **Javadoc** (`/** ... */`) to document code.
- Include **descriptive comments** explaining the purpose and behavior of code.
- Use the standard **Javadoc tags**:
  - `@param` ‚Äì Describes method parameters.
  - `@return` ‚Äì Describes the return value.
  - `@throws` ‚Äì Specifies possible exceptions.
  - `@see` ‚Äì Links related methods or classes.
  - `@since` ‚Äì Specifies version information.

### üìù **Javadoc Example**
```java
/**
 * Represents a user in the system.
 * Stores basic information such as name and age.
 */
public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    /**
     * Constructor for new user.
     *
     * @param name User's name.
     * @param age User's age.
     */
    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the user's name.
     *
     * @return The name of the user.
     */
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Generating Javadoc**
To generate documentation, run the following command:

```sh
javadoc -encoding UTF-8 -charset UTF-8 -d docs src/*.java
```

#### üîß **Using IntelliJ IDEA**
1. Go to **Tools** ‚Üí **Generate JavaDoc**.
2. Set `-encoding UTF-8 -charset UTF-8` in **additional options**.
3. Click **OK**.
