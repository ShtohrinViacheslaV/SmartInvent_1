## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Main programming language.
- **Kotlin**: Used for some parts of the project.
- **Gradle**: Build automation tool.
- **SQL**: Database management.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.

## üíª System Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Java 17+** for backend development.
- **Android Studio** for mobile application development.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database management system.
- **Gradle** for project build automation.
- **ZXing library** for QR code generation and scanning.

## üèõ Architectural Patterns and Design Principles

SmartInvent_1 follows modern software development patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates business logic (Model), user interface (View), and request handling (Controller) to enhance modularity.
- **Repository Pattern**: Provides a clear separation between the business logic and data access layer.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Utilized via Spring Boot to manage component dependencies efficiently.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Applied for managing configurations and database connections.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for event-driven updates, particularly in real-time inventory tracking.
- **RESTful API Design**: Backend services expose RESTful endpoints for seamless communication with the mobile application.


## üìå Code Documentation Rules

This project is developed in **Java** and follows industry standards for clean code and documentation.  
We use **Javadoc** for code documentation to ensure clarity and maintainability.

### ‚úÖ **General Guidelines**
- Use **Javadoc** (`/** ... */`) to document code.
- Include **descriptive comments** explaining the purpose and behavior of code.
- Use the standard **Javadoc tags**:
  - `@param` ‚Äì Describes method parameters.
  - `@return` ‚Äì Describes the return value.
  - `@throws` ‚Äì Specifies possible exceptions.
  - `@see` ‚Äì Links related methods or classes.
  - `@since` ‚Äì Specifies version information.

### üìù **Javadoc Example**
```java
/**
 * Represents a user in the system.
 * Stores basic information such as name and age.
 */
public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    /**
     * Constructor for new user.
     *
     * @param name User's name.
     * @param age User's age.
     */
    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the user's name.
     *
     * @return The name of the user.
     */
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Generating Javadoc**
To generate documentation, run the following command:

```sh
javadoc -encoding UTF-8 -charset UTF-8 -d docs src/*.java
```

#### üîß **Using IntelliJ IDEA**
1. Go to **Tools** ‚Üí **Generate JavaDoc**.
2. Set `-encoding UTF-8 -charset UTF-8` in **additional options**.
3. Click **OK**.
